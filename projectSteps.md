#1. Download Dependencies
at root of application (don't cd into data yet)

npm install - downloads dependencies & creates node modules folder
npm i express - package.json should now include express dependency 

#2. Create index.js file 

Add index.js at root of application => index.js will become the api 

#3. Set up index.js 
const express = require('express');
etc... 

#4. Start up application 

npm run server 
or npm start if script is already there. 
Should now show up in localhost:8000
